### Work
- **Uber**: built a lot of things at related to money: payments on the mobile and web, in the Rider, Driver and Eats app. Worked on some of the high-load [distributed systems](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/distributed-architecture-concepts-i-have-learned-while-building-payments-systems/) powering these products. The money systems handled more than $50B/year for more than 100M monthly users. Started as an engineer and I ended up managing a few teams later on.
- **Skyscanner**: launched [Skyscanner TravelPro](https://www.travolution.com/articles/14875/skyscanner-takes-step-into-business-travel-with-travelpro): a coprorate travel booking solution. We signed up Transferwise as the first customer, then a few more companies, before realizing we did not hit product-market fit. I moved to Uber as we pivoted - and later the service was merged back into Skyscanner (a fancy way of saying it shut down). 
- **Skype / Microsoft**: worked on teams building a few standalone Skype products: Skype for Xbox One, Skype for the web and integrating Skype into Outlook.com. These products were used by more than 400M people at the time. Also built Skype for Firefox OS on an internal hackathon, but we never launched this one.
- **JP Morgan**: built equity derivatives trading systems (exotics and delta ones) at JP Morgan. Sounds more complicated than it actually was. WPF, Java and the lot.
- **Mobile apps**: was a profilic [Windows Phone developer](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2012/08/22/flowing-apps-with-developer-gergely-orosz/), building apps with over 15M total downloads.

### Open Source
- Helped open source [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs), Uber's cross-platform mobile architecture framework. I did [some talks on RIBs](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/talks/#mobile-architecture-at-scale) as well.
- Co-built [SkyFloatingLabelTextField](https://github.com/Skyscanner/SkyFloatingLabelTextField), a Swift implementation of the "float label textfield".
- ðŸ’€ Open sourced [AdRotator](https://github.com/Adrotator/AdrotatorV2), a highly customizable ad rotation solution for Windows Phone and Windows 8. At its peak, over 1,000 apps were using (and making money with) this component.
